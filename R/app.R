        ensure that these spaces are equitable so all students can grow. Building on the data captured from the 2022 
        survey, the DEI team aims to analyze what has changed in the computing fields at BU since then. From the 
        inauguration of a new school to the addition of many new professors, how have these variables changed what

        to win the prizes. In the future, survey administrators could ensure that surveys cannot be submitted until all

        p("The rating using adjectives section asked respondents to rank the department of their major on a scale from 1-5, with 
          each end of the scale being an adjective. For example, one pair of adjectives were hostile and friendly, with 1 representing 
          hostile and 5 representing friendly. A response of 5 ranks the major department closer to friendly whereas a response of 2 ranks 
          the department closer to hostile. The adjectives on the right end of the spectrum are generally more positive but this is not true 
          for all of the pairs of adjectives. A few pairs may be seen as more neutral in morality. When comparing adjectives “A” and “B”, 
          responses 1-5 can be interpreted as “Definitely A”, “Somewhat A”, “Neutral”, “Somewhat B”, and “Definitely B”, respectively. For a 
          full list of the adjective ranges, please visit the Build a Graph Tab."),

          where more student responses fall closer to the left end of the spectrum towards 1, many students feel as though their department is 
          either neutral or performing poorly in being very competitive, elitist, and noncooperative, and inflexible. While these responses are 
          not necessarily negative, depending on the values of departments, they may indicate areas where work can be done. If a goal for the 
          departments is to not be elitist and instead be more accessible to all students, having 56% of respondents feel like their department 
          is elitist or somewhere in the middle shows that goal is not currently being met. It is possible this competitive environment is contributing 
          to the stress levels of students. In this survey, the majority of respondents indicated they are sometimes or often times stressed and a stressful 
          environment can have a negative impact on a student’s ability to learn."),
        p("Student responses begin to slightly differ when the results are organized using other variables. When students were
          asked to rank their department on a scale between “Homogenous” and “Diverse”, the majority of Black students ranked their
          department between 1-3, with the median value being 2. This suggests that the Black students who responded to this survey
          rank their department as more homogenous than diverse."),

          more likely to respond with Yes or Maybe in comparison to students who identified as male. This may be due to the fact that victims of inappropriate 
          behavior are more likely to realize and report these behaviors. "),

      p("With an overall lens on the survey data, many areas of climate in tech related departments at BU provide positive experiences 
        for a broad swath of students. These successes can be leveraged in strengthening the other areas that need improvement. While 
        survey numbers often indicated a majority leaning more favorable than unfavorable, it should still be acknowledged that a simple 
        majority is not enough. Response rates illustrating positive experiences falling in the 50-60 range is not reasonable. And of 
        course, there is parity in areas, and wide discrepancies in others. More specifically, as results are disaggregated by historically 
        underrepresented and disadvantaged students, the experience of campus culture within these disciplines reflect more instances of 
        negativity and less feelings of inclusion. In the 2024 survey, steps were taken to address additional variables such as differently 
        abled, sexual identity, language, religion, class, and neurodiversity. These additional categories filled major gaps from the 2022 
        survey.  A deeper analysis of experiences through intersectional factors will allow for more insight into the interactions students 
        have with various parts of the campus community. In the biannual survey attempt, more questions could be asked of students in a way 
        that a more representative sample is obtained. We could attempt stratified sampling and ensure a base number of respondents in each 
        subcategory such as race or major to ensure that we have enough respondents of all possible sub-combinations to draw conclusions from."),

    "1. Top Graph When a variable is not selected (or 'none' selected),
    the top graph, ‘count’, displays the total number of students that selected each response. When a variable
    is selected, the responses will be broken down by the selected variable. This means if the variable ‘gender’
    is selected, the values in this graph will show the number of self-identified female students, self-identified
    male students, etc. that selected each response.

    2. Bottom Graph When a variable is not selected (or 'none' selected), the bottom graph, ‘prop’, displays
    the total number of students that selected each response, in proportion to the total number of students that
    responded to the question. When a variable is selected, the responses will be broken down by the selected variable.
    This means if the variable ‘gender’ is selected, the values in this graph will show the number of self-identified-
    female students, self-identified male students, etc. that selected each response, in proportion to the total number
    of self-identified female students, self-identified male students etc. that responded to the question.

    3. Example
    For example, let’s say we’re looking at the question, 'Have you ever experienced discrimination or disrespectful/
    inappropriate behavior in your major department?' and the gender variable is selected. In the top graph, when
    looking at the values for the 'No' response, female has a value of 110. This means 110 self-identified female
    students responded No. In the bottom graph, when looking at the values for the 'No' response, female has a value
    of 64%. This means 64% of all self-identified female students responded No.
